Parallel Meshing Test

Motivations:
Preparing parallel solver execution without redundant calculations,
i.e. writing mesh into processor* dirs without decomposePar.

Succeeded Parallel Mesing:
mpirun -np 8 -hostfile hostfile cartesianMesh -parallel
gives ideal result, only for meshes.
0 directories are not copied/decomposed...

Solution Ideas:
- Add 0 dirs after mpirun cartesianMesh...
- Find a way to run decomposePar without coping mesh data

Add 0 dirs after mpirun carteisanMesh works!
set processor* boundary type processor...
be careful not to forget scaleMesh
